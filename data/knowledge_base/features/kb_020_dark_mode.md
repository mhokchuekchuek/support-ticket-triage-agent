## Enabling Dark Mode

   - **Light**: Always use light theme
   - **Dark**: Always use dark theme

2. Select **Appearance** tab
3. Choose your preferred theme

### Mobile App

2. Go to **Settings > Display**

## Browser Extension

The browser extension follows your main app settings. Changes sync automatically.

## Known Limitations

- Some embedded content may not respect dark mode
- PDF previews display in original colors
- Third-party integrations may show in light mode
- Email notifications are always light themed

## Accessibility Considerations

- Dark mode reduces eye strain in low-light conditions
- High contrast options available in Settings > Accessibility
- Custom color schemes available on Enterprise plans

## Roadmap

Upcoming dark mode improvements:
- Custom accent colors (Q2)
- Scheduled auto-switching (Q2)
- Per-workspace theme settings (Q3)

## Workarounds (Free Plan)

While waiting for full access:
- Use browser extensions like "Dark Reader"
- Enable system-wide dark mode on your OS
