## Understanding Access Issues

Access problems typically fall into three categories:
1. **Permission-based**: Your role doesn't include access
2. **Plan-based**: The feature requires a higher plan
3. **Technical**: Temporary system issues

## Permission-Based Access

### Checking Your Role

1. Go to **Settings > Account > My Profile**
2. View your current role under "Team Role"
3. Common roles: Viewer, Member, Admin, Owner

### Role Capabilities

| Role | View | Edit | Delete | Manage Users | Billing |
|------|------|------|--------|--------------|---------|
| Viewer | Yes | No | No | No | No |
| Member | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| Admin | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| Owner | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

### Requesting Higher Access

1. Identify your team admin (Settings > Team > Members)
2. Contact them to request role upgrade
3. Admins can change roles in Settings > Team > Members

## Plan-Based Access

### Feature Availability by Plan

Some features are restricted by plan:
- **Free**: Basic features only
- **Pro**: Advanced features, integrations
- **Enterprise**: All features, custom options

### Checking Feature Requirements

When you see "Upgrade Required":
1. Click the upgrade prompt to see required plan
2. Compare your current plan in Settings > Billing
3. Contact your admin if organization controls billing

### Upgrading Your Plan

1. Go to **Settings > Billing > Plans**
2. Select desired plan
3. Complete payment (admins only)
4. Access granted immediately after upgrade

## Technical Access Issues

### 403 Forbidden Errors

This error means you're authenticated but not authorized:
- Verify you're in the correct workspace/organization
- Check if the resource was shared with you
- Ensure link/invite hasn't expired

### Workspace Access

If you can't access a specific workspace:
1. Confirm you were invited to that workspace
2. Check your email for pending invitations
3. Ask the workspace admin to re-send invitation

### Shared Resource Access

For shared files/folders/projects:
- Links may have expiration dates
- Permissions may be revoked by owner
- Some shares require login to access

## Team Management Issues

### Invitation Problems

If your invitation isn't working:
- Check if it was sent to correct email
- Invitations expire after 7 days
- Ask admin to resend if expired

### Removed from Team

If suddenly unable to access:
- You may have been removed from team
- Check with team admin about status
- Your personal data is preserved if removed

## Getting Help

For persistent access issues:
1. Document the exact error message
2. Note which feature/resource you're trying to access
3. Include your account email in support request
4. Screenshot the error if possible
