## Common Login Issues

### Forgotten Password

1. Click **Forgot Password** on the login page
2. Enter your account email address
3. Check your inbox (and spam folder) for reset link
4. Click the link within 24 hours
5. Create a new password (minimum 8 characters)

**Note**: Reset links expire after 24 hours. Request a new one if expired.

### Incorrect Password

- Passwords are case-sensitive
- Check Caps Lock is not enabled
- Ensure no extra spaces before/after password
- Try typing password in a text editor first to verify

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Issues

#### Lost Authenticator App Access
1. Use a **backup code** (provided during 2FA setup)
2. Each backup code works only once
3. If no backup codes, contact support with identity verification

#### Authenticator Not Working
- Ensure your device time is correct (auto-sync recommended)
- Time drift can cause code mismatches
- Try the next code if current one fails

#### Lost Phone/Device
- Use backup codes to regain access
- Once logged in, disable and re-enable 2FA with new device
- Contact support if no backup codes available

### Account Locked

Accounts lock after 5 failed login attempts:
- **Wait 15 minutes** for automatic unlock
- Or click **Unlock Account** in the lockout email
- Contact support if you didn't trigger the lockout (possible security issue)

## SSO Login Issues

If using Single Sign-On:
1. Ensure you're using the correct SSO provider
2. Contact your IT admin if SSO fails
3. Check if your organization's SSO is configured correctly
4. Try the direct email/password login if SSO is temporarily down

## Browser Issues

- Clear cookies for our domain specifically
- Disable browser extensions (especially ad blockers)
- Try incognito/private mode
- Update to the latest browser version

## Account Status

Your login may fail if:
- Account is deactivated (contact your admin)
- Subscription expired (check billing status)
- Account deleted (contact support for recovery options)
