## Overview

If you see duplicate charges on your account, we apologize for the inconvenience. Double charges can occur due to payment processing issues or browser timeouts during checkout.

## How to Identify a Double Charge

1. Check your **Billing History** in Settings > Billing
2. Compare with your bank/card statement
3. Note the exact amounts and dates of the duplicate charges

## Resolution Process

### Step 1: Verify the Duplicate

Sometimes what appears as a double charge is actually:
- A pending authorization that will be released
- A charge from a previous billing cycle
- Separate charges for different services

### Step 2: Report the Issue

1. Go to **Settings > Billing > Billing History**
2. Click on the duplicate charge
3. Select **Report Issue**
4. Choose "Duplicate/Double Charge"
5. Provide any additional details
6. Submit the report

### Step 3: Automatic Review

Our billing system will automatically:
- Flag the duplicate charge
- Initiate a review (24-48 hours)
- Process a refund if confirmed

## Timeline

- **Review**: 24-48 hours
- **Refund processing**: 3-5 business days after confirmation
- **Bank reflection**: Additional 3-5 business days

## Pending Authorizations

Note: Some "duplicate charges" are actually pending authorizations that will automatically disappear within 3-7 days. These occur when:
- Your initial payment attempt timed out
- You refreshed the payment page
- There was a temporary network issue

## Urgent Cases

For charges over $500 or if you need immediate assistance, contact our priority billing support at billing-urgent@example.com with your account email and charge details.
