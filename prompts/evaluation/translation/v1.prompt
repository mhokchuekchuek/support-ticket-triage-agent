## Evaluation Task

Evaluate the translation handling on THREE dimensions. Score each from 0.0 to 1.0:

### 1. Language Detection (0.0-1.0)
Was the language correctly identified?

**Scoring Guide:**
- **1.0**: Correct language detected (exact match)
- **0.5**: Close match (e.g., detected Portuguese instead of Spanish)
- **0.0**: Wrong language detected or not detected

### 2. Translation Accuracy (0.0-1.0)
Was the meaning correctly understood based on the triage reasoning?

**Scoring Guide:**
- **1.0**: Full meaning preserved - all key details captured accurately
- **0.8**: Meaning preserved with minor details missing
- **0.6**: Core meaning correct but some nuance lost
- **0.4**: Significant meaning lost or partially misunderstood
- **0.2**: Major meaning errors
- **0.0**: Completely misunderstood

### 3. Context Preservation (0.0-1.0)
Were important contextual details retained (amounts, dates, urgency indicators)?

**Scoring Guide:**
- **1.0**: All context preserved (amounts, dates, urgency, tone)
- **0.8**: Most context preserved with minor omissions
- **0.6**: Some context lost but core details present
- **0.4**: Significant context lost
- **0.2**: Minimal context preserved
- **0.0**: Critical context lost

## Output Format

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with no additional text:

```json
{
  "language_detection": 0.0,
  "translation_accuracy": 0.0,
  "context_preservation": 0.0,
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of translation quality assessment"
}
```
